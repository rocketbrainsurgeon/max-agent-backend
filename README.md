# üîµ Based Agent

An experimental playground for autonomous onchain interactions. 

## Introduction

Based Agent helps LLM agents directly interact with the blockchain, built on top of the [Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)](https://cdp.coinbase.com/) and OpenAI's [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm). 

### Key Features

- **Autonomous execution**: The agent thinks, decides, and acts onchain autonomously.
- **Token deployement**: Create and manage ERC-20 tokens.
- **NFT Deployment**: Deploy and mint NFTs. 
- **Asset transfers**: Transfer assets between addresses without manual intervention.
- **Balance checks**: Keep tabs on wallet balances.
- **ETH faucet requests**: Automatically request testnet ETH when needed.
- **Art generation via DALL-E**: Generate artwork using AI.

### Why Based Agent?

Imagine an AI agent that not only interacts with the blockchain but does so creatively and autonomously. Whether you're a developer, an artist, or someone curious about AI, Based Agent offers a unique and exciting playground to:

- Experiment with autonomous agent capabilities.
- Explore on-chain actions without manual coding.
- Understand the potential of AI onchain.

## Get Started in Minutes!

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Replit Core Account (optional, but recommended for easy setup).  Contact sales@replit.com for a free uppgrade (just mention coinbase)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ API Configuration
Add your secrets to Replit's Secret Manager or set them as environment variables:
- `CDP_API_KEY_NAME`: Your CDP API key name.
- `CDP_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your CDP private key.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

You can get the Coinbase Developer Platform API key here: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/
And the OpenAI key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (note you will need to have a paid account)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Agent

After adding your API Keys to the Secrets pane, you start the agent by pressing the green "‚ñ∂ Run" Button at the top of the editor

Alternatively, you can start the based agent manually by navigating to the Replit shell and running:

```bash
python run.py
```

### Watch the Magic Happen! ‚ú®

The Based Agent will start its autonomous loop:

- Wakes up every 10 seconds.
- Chooses an onchain action based on its capabilities.
- Executes the action onchain.
- Prints results in a human-readable format.

## ü§î How Does Based Agent Work?

Based Agent makes decisions and interacts with the blockchain autonomously. Here's what happens under the hood:

- **Decision making**: The agent decides what action to perform next.
- **Onchain interaction**: Executes blockchain transactions using the CDP SDK.
- **Art generation**: If needed, generates art using OpenAI's DALL-E.
- **Feedback loop**: Analyzes results and plans the next action.

## üîß Available Functions

Unlock a world of possibilities with these built-in functions:

### Token Operations

- `create_token(name, symbol, initial_supply)`: Create a new ERC-20 token.
- `transfer_asset(amount, asset_id, destination_address)`: Transfer assets to a specific address.
- `get_balance(asset_id)`: Check the wallet balance of a specific asset.

### NFT Operations

- `deploy_nft(name, symbol, base_uri)`: Deploy a new ERC-721 NFT contract.
- `mint_nft(contract_address, mint_to)`: Mint an NFT to a specified address.

### Utilities

- `request_eth_from_faucet()`: Request ETH from the Base Sepolia testnet faucet.
- `generate_art(prompt)`: Generate art using DALL-E based on a text prompt.

### Advanced (Experimental)

- `create_liquidity_pool(token0_address, token1_address, fee_tier, amount0, amount1)`: Create a Uniswap V3 liquidity pool and add initial liquidity.

## Live Demo

Curious to see Based Agent in action? Here's a sneak peek:

```bash
Starting autonomous Based Agent loop...

System: It's been 10 seconds. I want you to do some sort of onchain action based on my capabilities. Let's get crazy and creative!

Based Agent: I've decided to deploy a new NFT collection!

deploy_nft(name="Cyber Artifacts", symbol="CYART", base_uri="https://example.com/metadata/")

Successfully deployed NFT contract 'Cyber Artifacts' (CYART) at address 0xABC123... with base URI: https://example.com/metadata/
```

## ü§ñ Behind the Scenes

Based Agent uses:

- **Coinbase Developer Platform SDK**: For seamless onchain interactions.
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Powers the agent's autonomous decision-making.
- **DALL-E**: Generates art from textual descriptions.
